# # Project 1: Machine Learning Classifiers

## Introduction  
This project explores and compares the linear machine learning classifiers we went over in class on and teseted them on the **UCI Adult Income dataset**. Our goal is to predict whether an individual’s income is over \$50K per year based on demographic and employment attributes.  


## Attributes

| Attribute          | Attribute        |
|--------------------|------------------|
| Age                | Occupation       |
| Workclass          | Relationship     |
| Education          | Race             |
| Marital Status     | Sex              |
| Capital Gain        | Hours Per Week   |
| Native Country     |    Capital Loss              |


We used both **custom algorithms** from *Machine Learning with PyTorch and Scikit-Learn* (Raschka, Liu, & Mirjalili, 2022) and **scikit-learn**, so we can see the differences in performance, convergence, and generalization. The purpose of the project is to learn the classic algorithms and there optimized counterparts.
